Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000
a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of pigmented lesions

Training of neural networks for automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is hampered by the small size and lack of diversity of available dataset of dermatoscopic images.
We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset.

collected dermatoscopic images from different populations, acquired and stored by different modalities.
 The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes.

Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions: Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec), basal cell carcinoma (bcc), benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl), dermatofibroma (df), melanoma (mel), melanocytic nevi (nv) and vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).

The dataset includes lesions with multiple images, which can be tracked by the lesion_id-column within the HAM10000_metadata file.
